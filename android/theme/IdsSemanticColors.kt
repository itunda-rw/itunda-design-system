/**
 * Theme-reactive semantic tokens -- the fix for a real bug found 2026-07-10:
 * IdsColors, IdsButton, and IdsListRow were all hardcoded constants that never
 * changed between light/dark, even though IdsTheme() built a real Material
 * ColorScheme nothing actually read. IDS.kt (core/designsystem/ids) had zero
 * dark-mode values at all. ItundaAppScreen.kt had a third, ad-hoc set of
 * inline dark-mode colors, hand-tuned but duplicated nowhere else.
 *
 * Light values are the real Toss light palette -- IdsColors' Gray900/Gray700/
 * Gray500/Gray200/Gray100 and the separately-ported IDS.Colors arrived at the
 * same hex values independently, which is why they're used directly below
 * rather than invented.
 *
 * Dark values corrected 2026-07-21, superseding the previous true-black
 * background: the 2026-07-10 fix above was based on eyeballing user-provided
 * screenshots, which can't reliably distinguish true black from a very dark
 * grey (especially compressed/OLED). Toss's actual currently-published
 * `@toss/tds-colors@0.1.0` npm package (registry.npmjs.org, real maintainers
 * incl. toss-build-bot, updated through March 2026) ships raw adaptive dark
 * values directly as CSS custom properties -- `--adaptiveBackground: #17171c`
 * (not black), `--adaptiveBackgroundLevel01: #202027`, `--adaptiveBackgroundLevel02:
 * #2c2c35`, `--adaptiveBlue500: #3485fa`, `--adaptiveHairlineBorder: #3c3c47`.
 * Mapped by role, not guessed: Level01/02 are named elevation steps above the
 * base background, matching this struct's surface/surfaceSoft split exactly.
 * `pressed`/`success`/`warning`/`danger`/the tint colors are deliberately left
 * untouched -- the real package only exposes the raw numbered scale, not which
 * step its own semantic "danger"/"pressed" roles point to, and guessing would
 * repeat the exact mistake this comment is fixing.
